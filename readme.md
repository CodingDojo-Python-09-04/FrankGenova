I work in Health Care IT and have a lot of familiarity with Epic electronic medical records, which is built on an InterSystems Cach√® MUMPS database.  Over the last few years I've learned some MUMPS programming.

Over time I think Epic will introduce more APIs, Web Services and other parts of the application that utilize the things we learned in Web Fundamentals.

MUMPS is not widely used (as far as I know, it is a niche language especiall popular in medicine).  I have co-workers who work on Data Science projects and Web Applications.  I found the work they do very interesting.  They use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python etc.

For the short term I want to learn how to use Python to automate work tasks and process/parse text.  I'm interested in how it might be used to remediate an HL7 message project.

For the long term I want skills that help me create cool solutions outside of the Epic framework that will really help the users get the information they need with minimal hassle.
